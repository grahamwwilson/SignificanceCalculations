Files are:

cl.sh       Unix shell script to compile specified executable linking against ROOT library

Source code: testPoisson.cpp testzbi.cpp, testchi2.cpp

To make each:

./cl.sh testPoisson
./cl.sh testzbi
./cl.sh testchi2

testPoisson calculates observed significance using observed event number, 
background-only expectation, and the uncertainty on this background. 
The underlying model is assumed to be Poisson with the mean parameter being 
normally distributed.

testzbi does some significance calculations using z-binomial etc.

testchi2 is a not completely, but somewhat 
unrelated toy MC for generating chi-squared distributed variates that 
I happened to have in the same directory.
