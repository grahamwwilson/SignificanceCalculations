Files are:

cl.sh       Unix shell script to compile specified executable linking against ROOT library

Source code: testzbi.cpp and testchi2.cpp

To make each:

./cl.sh testzbi
./cl.sh testchi2

testzbi does some significance calculations using z-binomial etc.

testchi2 is a not completely, but somewhat 
unrelated toy MC for generating chi-squared distributed variates that 
I happened to have in the same directory.
